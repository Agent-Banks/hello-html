    <h2>1. Working on Cars</h2>
    <h3>The Story</h3>
    <p>
      When I bought my first car, I put so much time and effort into fixing it
      up and making it better than what it looked like when it came out of the
      factory. My first car was a 2001 Mitsubishi Eclipse V6 manual Spyder GT. I
      wanted to have a stick shift as my first car, because I felt like if I did
      not learn now, I would never learn. I was surprised to figure out that
      stick shift was not to hard to learn!
    </p>
    <h3>The Work</h3>
    <p>
      I have to admit I put way to much money into a car that was only worth
      $3,000, but I loved working on it. At first, before wanting to become a
      Software Developer, I wanted to be a mechanic. This changed shortly after
      I realized that I hated being covered in grease and oil all day. Some of
      the work I completed is listed below:
      <ol>
        <li>Switching out the stock headlights with aftermarket LED lights</li>
        <li>Switching out the stock fog lights with aftermarket LED lights</li>
        <li>Painting some of the ugly interior parts black to match the color of the car</li>
        <li>Installing an aftermarket radio</li>
        <li>Re-painting the car black</li>
        <li>Painting the rims black to match the color of the car</li>
        <li>Removing Stock suspension and replaced with coilovers</li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <h3>The Downfall</h3>
    <p>Sadly, like most first cars, it eventually died :(</p>
    <p>The clutch burned out after 150,000 miles and I could no longer drive the car around. 
       The story about where this happened is one to be told for another day.</p>
